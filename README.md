# data-science-notebooks
This repository is used for sharing data science, machine learning and deep learning things. This repository mainly uses Python for code. I'm trying to make the repository clearly understood for data science newbies.

To get started with this repository, create a folder and run the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/NgocDuy3112/data-science-notebooks.git`

You need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) in order to run the code in local. 

To update the repository, run the following command: `git pull`.

Feel free to use and report any issues or questions about this repository.
